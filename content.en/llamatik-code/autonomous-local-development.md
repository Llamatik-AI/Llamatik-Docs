# Autonomous Local Development

Llamatik Code 1.8.0 ships **Autonomous Local Development** — a mission-driven coding environment. You describe a task, the agent plans it, applies patches, and verifies the result — entirely on your machine.

**Core guarantee:** your source code never leaves your device.

---

## What is a local coding mission?

A mission is a discrete, goal-oriented task you hand to the agent:

- Fix this build failure
- Refactor this module without changing behavior
- Generate tests for the current file
- Review the current git changes before committing
- Implement this feature end-to-end

The agent runs a structured workflow for each mission:

1. Gather project context (git state, code health, architecture)
2. Classify the mission type and detect risks
3. Create a plan with explicit verification steps and rollback instructions
4. Apply small, reviewable patches
5. Show a diff before every multi-file write
6. Verify the result (build, tests, or IDE diagnostics)
7. Produce an audit report

## Starting a mission

**From the tool window:**

Type a mission description in the chat input and press Enter. Mission-aware phrasing like "fix the build failure", "refactor the auth module", or "generate tests for UserService" triggers the full enterprise workflow automatically.

**From the editor right-click menu:**

Right-click in any editor → **Llamatik Code → Autonomous Local Development** → choose an action.

**Available context actions:**

| Action | Description |
|---|---|
| Enterprise Pair Programmer | Full mission session on the current file or project |
| Review Current Changes | Code review of uncommitted git changes |
| Fix Build Failure | Analyse and repair the last build failure |
| Generate Tests | Produce tests for the current file |
| Explain Architecture | Describe responsibilities and dependencies of the current module |
| Safe Refactor | Refactor selected code or the current file without behavior change |
| Implement Feature | Guided feature implementation with plan and diff |
